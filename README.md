# ACTPolLite.jl
A Julia implementation of the Data Release 4 (DR4) CMB power spectrum likelihood measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), from the 2013â€“2016 survey covering >15,000 sq. deg. This spectrum has already been marginalized over SZ and foreground emission. The polarization efficiency is the only nuisance parameter required to be sampled. It is based on the WMAP and ACT team's likelihood software.
